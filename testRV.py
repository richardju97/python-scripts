# Things to Test: 
# 	Different Random Variables (Bernoulli, Binomial, Geometric, Negative Binomial, Poisson)
# 	Expected Value and Variance of each Random Variable
# 	Summation of Bernoulli (Binomial)
# 	Summation of Binomial (Binomial) - function doesn't exist yet
# 	Summation of Geometric (Negative Binomial)
# 	Summation of Negative Binomial (Negative Binomial) - function doesn't exist yet
# 	Summation of Poisson (Poisson) - function doesn't exist yet
