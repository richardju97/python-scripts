Python Scripts

What is it?
-----------

This is a collection of various python scripts that I've written.
The goal of these scripts is to make performing various tasks more efficient 
(in comparison to doing them by hand/manually calculating them, etc.)

Files Included in this Folder
-----------------------------

1. costCalculator.py
2. goldenHour.py

All files are left within the same directory/repository and therefore one README file.
This is so that no matter what script is being run, you'll always cd into the same directory.
