# Collection of various calculations/operations related to binary strings
# Also includes some similar calculations that aren't exclusive to binary (e.g. decimal to hex)

# Given Decimal, Convert to Binary

# Given Decimal, Convert to Oct

# Given Decimal, Convert to Hex

# Given Oct, Convert to Decimal

# Given Hex, Convert to Decimal

# Given Oct, Convert to Hex

# Given Hex, Convert to Oct

# Given Unsigned Int Binary String, Convert to Decimal

# Given Binary String, Convert to ASCII
# Note that MSB is ignored as signs do not impact ASCII characters
# This stays consistent with the CS 25000 "Computer Architecture" Course Curriculum at Purdue University

# Given 1C, Convert to Decimal

# Given 2C, Convert to Decimal

# Given 2C, Convert from Xbits to Ybits (increasing bits)
# not sure if decreasing bits would be possible
